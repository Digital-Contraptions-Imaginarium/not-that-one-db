not-that-one-db
===============

## Introduction
This repository contains the set of rules by which Giacecco chooses what packaged food **not** to buy, using (upcoming) Digital Contraptions Imaginarium's [**Not That One!**](http://www.digitalcontraptionsimaginarium.co.uk/not-that-one/) mobile app.

## You are welcome to contribute...
You can contribute to this repository by forking it and submitting your improvements back as pull requests. E.g. if you find one more brand that homogenise their milk, add it [here](https://github.com/giacecco/not-that-one-db/blob/master/tells/homogenised_milk.json). Or, if you mistakenly bought sausages with little or no pork in them, add them [here](https://github.com/giacecco/not-that-one-db/blob/master/tells/pork_meat_in_sausages.json). 

You are welcome to leave notes, see an example of how to do it [here](https://github.com/giacecco/not-that-one-db/blob/master/tells/pork_meat_in_sausages.json).

## ... or to define rules for your own use
You can define your own set of rules, too! Fork this repository and re-configure your **Not That One!** app to point at your rules rather than mine. You can see [here](http://www.digitalcontraptionsimaginarium.co.uk/not-that-one/#/4/1) how that is done. Note that the repository name must be "not-that-one-db".
